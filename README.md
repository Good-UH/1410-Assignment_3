Program that computes clothing sizes based on height, weight, and age

Write a program that asks for the person's height, weight, and age,
and then computes clothing sizes according to the formulas: 
Hat Size = weight in pounds divided by height in inches and all that multiplied by 2.9.
Waist in inches = weight divided by 5.7 and then adjusted by adding 1/10 of an inch for 
each 2 years over age 28. Assume that the user will ALWAYS enter a number BUT you
should check if the number is larger than 0(zero) for each variable.
